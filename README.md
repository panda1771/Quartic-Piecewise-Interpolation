# Quartic-Piecewise-Interpolation

This repository demonstrates a new interpolation method: Quartic Piecewise Spline Interpolation. The code sets up several restraints on how the interpolation graph should behave. The smoothness of the curve is accounted for with different calculus techniques, and is all merged together with linear algebra by implementing a stiffness matrix. The code for the generation of an interpolated graph given a set of data points is located under the file "QuarticPiecewiseInterpolate.py".
